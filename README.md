## Project Requirements

- [x] Write Ansbile playbook `setup.yaml`. When you run the playbook, it should run the roles above in sequence.
- [x] Write Ansible Role `base` (basic server setup (installs utilities, updates the server, installs `fail2ban`, etc.))
- [x] Write Ansible role `nginx` (installs and configures `nginx`)
- [x] Write Ansible role `app` (uploads the given tarball of a static HTML website to the server and unzips it)
- [x] Write Ansible role `ssh` (adds the given public key to the server)
- [x] Setup the inventory.ini to include the server you are going to configure
- [x] You should also assign proper tags to the roles so that you can run only specific roles
- [x] **Advanced**. Modify the app role to pull the repository from GitHub and deploy it
